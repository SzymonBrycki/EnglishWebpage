	<p>Oh boy...</p>
	
	<p>I use a lot of social networks, I do believe. Of course, my favorite one is <strong>Facebook</strong>. Thanks to that website, I'm able to communicate with my friends - most of whom are far away - I browse news, get exposed to new memeses and jokes etc. Yup, Facebook is really good!</p>

	<p>I also have an account on <strong>Twitter</strong>, which is not so popular among Poles in my opinion. Twitter serves me mostly as a medium to get to know current political news and climate - and some of my favorite artists are available only on Twitter, which is an additional incentive to use this website.</p>

	<p>I also have a profile on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. For some reasons I do not wanna discuss here I have never worked, but if I will be able one day - today I am not - it will be probably thanks to my account on LI.</p>

	<p>An additional thing - I have a userpage on <strong>LibraryThing</strong>, which is basically Goodreads, but more professional. My book collection is nowadays in two separate flats in two different cities, but if I will get them in one place I am gonna start cataloguing them. I can;t wait to meet book lovers who have the same literary taste as I do! What a pleasure it is gonna be!</p>
