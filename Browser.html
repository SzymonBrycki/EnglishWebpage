	<p>Currently, I am using <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. It is fast, I can access my bookmarks from any computer, it is well integrated with Google services such as Gmail and Gdrive/GDocs. I believe that from all the web browsers available today, Chrome is the best choice.</p>

	<p>However, it was not always like that. Before Chrome, I was using <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>. It was fast too, had bookmarks - in times of old <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> - who remembers that? Dizozaurs? - the possibility of having opened more than one website at a time was a great progress. Also, I sometimes still miss the graphical skins to Firefox. It is something that Google Chrome does not have, which is kind of a shame, actually.</p>
